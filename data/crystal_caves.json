Additionally, I worked with a partner utilising google cloud services to create a user-friendly interface accessible on both mobile and desktop. The website serves as a content hub for the school's news program and features an admin panel for users to upload their own content. I am proud to have contributed to the school's community and their mission of sharing stories through the Lion's Roar; sharing student voices."
