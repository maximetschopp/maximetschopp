My entry was cave themed, more specifically, a crystal cave. I sketched designs on paper, and on my iPad, then <strong>created</strong> and <strong>modelled</strong> the assets in blender and substance 3D painter. Although I wasn't one of the winners, the project help me <strong>develop</strong> and become confident in my 3D workflow, which then I was able to apply to my later projects like the <a href='/project/tlr_intro'>Intro for The Lion's Roar.</a> <br><br> Here is the video of the full marble machine containing all submissions:"
